# Object Detector Training
The google colab notebook I used for training and detections I used is found in the YOLOv3ModelTraining.ipynb file. The notebook contains instructions on how to set up to train and run detections. The config file is also in the Github. The weights I trained can be found here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dd0Mtbd1UXcrUwnTj_M0cIBJhjGeM7bb/view?usp=sharing. 

# Performance Evaluation
The code I used to assess model performance from previously run detections are found in the accuracy.py file.

# Graph Generation
The code I used to generate the graphs from previously run detections are found in the graphs.py file.

# LIME Explanation
The google colab notebook I used for LIME explanation generation can be found in the LIME.ipynb file. The notebook contains instruction on how to run LIME on images using YOLOv3 darknet.

# Dataset
The detector was trained and tested on the SUN colonoscopy database. This dataset uses permission for use, so no images from the dataset has been included in the repository. If you wish to use the dataset please request permission at http://sundatabase.org.

# Final Report
The final report is found in KallanDuongFinalReport.pdf.
